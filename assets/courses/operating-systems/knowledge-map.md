# Knowledge Map: Operating Systems (CMS701)

> Generated: 2026-04-02 | Topics: 7 | Concepts: 45+ | Relationships: 39

## Course Overview

Operating Systems (CMS701) covers the fundamental principles of how an OS manages hardware and software resources. The course progresses from OS architecture (kernels, system calls) through process and thread management, CPU scheduling algorithms, multithreading models, and concludes with process synchronization — the mechanisms that keep concurrent processes safe and consistent. Two topics from the outline (Spooling, Mechanisms & Policies) are not yet covered in available lecture notes.

## Central Concepts

These are the most connected concepts in the course — master these first:

| Concept | Connections | Why Central |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **Process** | 8 | Foundation of all process management, scheduling, synchronization, and threading |
| **Kernel** | 7 | Core OS component; all system calls, thread management, and hardware access pass through it |
| **PCB (Process Control Block)** | 6 | The OS's complete record of a process; essential for context switching and scheduling |
| **Context Switch** | 6 | The mechanism that makes multitasking possible; connects PCB, schedulers, and CPU |
| **CPU Scheduling** | 6 | Governs all 6 scheduling algorithms and 3 scheduler types; directly affects performance |
| **Thread** | 5 | Lightweight execution unit; central to multithreading models and synchronization issues |
| **Deadlock** | 4 | Connects synchronization failures, resource management, and starvation |

|------|-------------------|
| **Operating System** | Software bridge between user and hardware; manages all resources |
| **Kernel** | Core OS component bridging applications and hardware |
| **Monolithic Kernel** | Single large program with all OS functions; fast but fragile |
| **Microkernel** | Minimal kernel; drivers/services in user space; stable but slower |
| **Hybrid Kernel** | Combines monolithic speed with microkernel modularity (e.g., Windows NT) |
| **System Call** | Program's request to kernel for privileged operations; bridges user/kernel mode |
| **Process** | A program in execution with its own code, state, and resources |
| **PID** | Unique numeric identifier assigned to each process by the OS |

| **Context Switch** | OS saving one process's state and loading another's to share CPU |
| **Program Counter** | Register holding address of the next instruction to execute |
| **Thread** | Smallest execution unit within a process; shares memory with siblings |
| **User-Level Thread** | Thread managed by app library; fast but no multiprocessor advantage |

| **Critical Section** | Code segment accessing shared resources; one process at a time only |
| **Race Condition** | Simultaneous shared-data access leading to unpredictable results |
| **Mutual Exclusion** | Guarantee only one process is in the critical section at a time |

| **Spooling** | ⚠ Pending — not yet covered in available lecture notes |

## Tutor Reference Notes

*For use during learning sessions:*

- **Best entry-point concept:** Start with *Process* — it anchors topics 3 through 7 and gives Mbosinwa (a software engineer) an immediately relatable mental model (every app he has built runs as processes).

- **Most common misconceptions in this course:**
  1. Confusing *context switch* with *process switch* — a context switch is the mechanism; a process switch is the event that triggers it.
  2. Thinking *multithreading* = *multiprocessing* — threads share memory; processes do not.
  3. Assuming *Shortest Job First* is always best — it causes starvation in practice.
  4. Thinking *deadlock* and *starvation* are the same — deadlock is a circular wait (no one proceeds); starvation is unfair scheduling (one never proceeds).

- **Concepts students typically conflate:**
  - **Deadlock** vs **Starvation** — both mean a process never runs, but deadlock is a circular dependency; starvation is a scheduling fairness failure.
  - **Preemptive** vs **Non-Preemptive** — easy to mix up which is "interruptible."
  - **User-Level Thread** vs **Kernel-Level Thread** — both are threads; difference is *who manages them*.
  - **Many-to-One** vs **One-to-One** — the naming is intuitive but the trade-offs (efficiency vs. parallelism) are what matter.
  - **PCB** vs **Process** — PCB is the *record* of a process, not the process itself.
  - **Short-Term Scheduler** vs **Dispatcher** — scheduler *decides*; dispatcher *executes* the switch.

- **⚠ Coverage gaps to flag during tutoring:**
  - Spooling, System Programs, Mechanisms & Policies not yet in lecture notes — flag if exam questions arise on these.
