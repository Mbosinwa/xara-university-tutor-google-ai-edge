## Course Overview

CMS707 covers the theory and practice of Artificial Intelligence — from the foundational question of what intelligence is, through problem-solving via state space search, to knowledge representation using predicate logic and probabilistic reasoning. The course then extends to advanced application areas including machine learning, NLP, expert systems, fuzzy logic, and genetic algorithms. It is grounded in the AIMA (Russell & Norvig) framework and closely follows Dr. Friday Orji's lecture series.

## Tutor Reference Notes

_For use by the tutor agent during learning sessions with Mbosinwa:_

- **Best Socratic entry point:** Start with "What makes a task difficult for a computer?" — bridges Mundane vs Formal Tasks and leads naturally into State Space Search
- **Most common misconceptions:**
  - Conflating *Agent Function* (abstract) with *Agent Program* (concrete)
  - Thinking BFS is always better than DFS — each has specific advantages
  - Believing Rational Agent = "smart agent" rather than "goal-maximising agent"
  - Confusing Iterative Deepening with repeated BFS
  - Thinking Predicate Logic is just maths — it's a KR tool for real-world facts
- **Concepts students typically conflate:**
  - BFS (Breadth-First) vs Best-First Search — different algorithms, confusingly named
  - Agent Function vs Agent Program
  - Percept vs Percept Sequence
  - Inferential KR vs Predicate Logic (the latter is a *form* of the former)
  - Supervised vs Reinforcement Learning
- **Mbosinwa context:** Strong engineering background, rusty on theory. Use real-world analogies. Over-explain — he will say when to stop.
- **Exercises available:** Session 1 (5 questions on AI theory/philosophy) and Session 2 (2 problem formulation tasks including Missionaries & Cannibals)
