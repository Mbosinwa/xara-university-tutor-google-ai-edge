## Course Overview

This course covers the foundational principles of data communication and computer networking — from the five basic components of a communication system, through signal representation and Fourier analysis, to physical and wireless transmission media, network types and topologies, switching and routing techniques, and the OSI reference model. It also covers how data is encoded as bit patterns, how serial and parallel transmission work in practice, and how Fourier mathematics powers real-world technologies like OFDM in 5G and LTE.

## Tutor Reference Notes

_For use by Dr. Sarah Joe during learning sessions:_

- **Best entry-point concept:** Start with the 5 components of a data communication system (Message, Sender, Receiver, Transmission Medium, Protocol) — every other topic in this course builds from here.

- **Most common misconceptions:**
  - Confusing *half-duplex* with *simplex* — half-duplex CAN go both ways, just not simultaneously
  - Thinking *digital* is always better than *analog* — depends entirely on context and medium
  - Believing OSI layers are strict physical hardware boundaries — they are logical abstractions
  - Confusing *routing* with *switching* — switching connects within a network; routing connects networks
  - Thinking *serial* is always slower than *parallel* — not true over long distances (parallel suffers skew)
  - Confusing *asynchronous* with *half-duplex* — they describe different aspects (timing vs direction)
  - Thinking only even harmonics cancel in a square wave — it's the even harmonics that cancel, odd survive

- **Concepts students typically conflate:**
  - `Circuit Switching` ↔ `Packet Switching` (dedicated path vs shared packets)
  - `Fourier Series` ↔ `Fourier Transform` (periodic vs non-periodic signals)
  - `Serial Transmission` ↔ `Asynchronous Transmission` (physical method vs timing/framing method)
  - `Parallel Transmission` ↔ `Full-Duplex` (multi-wire vs simultaneous bidirectional)
  - `STP` ↔ `UTP` (shielded vs unshielded twisted pair)
  - `Half-Duplex` ↔ `Full-Duplex` (sequential vs simultaneous)
  - `LAN` ↔ `MAN` ↔ `WAN` (geographic scope differences)
  - `Source Routing` ↔ `Hop-by-Hop Routing` (who decides the path)
  - `Radio Waves` ↔ `Microwaves` (directionality: omni vs uni; frequency range)
  - `Asynchronous` ↔ `Synchronous` Transmission (character-framed vs block-framed)

- **Mbosinwa-specific notes:**
  - Has strong software/systems engineering background — use analogies to protocols (HTTP, TCP), buses (USB, SPI), and embedded systems (RS-232, RS-485) when explaining networking concepts
  - Over-explain by default; he will signal if something needs less detail
  - Fourier mathematics may need extra scaffolding — connect abstract formulas to concrete examples (square wave, OFDM, 5G) to build intuition
